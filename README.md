###README
UFC Project
I am a big fan of UFC. I also like numbers. It is known that UFC doesn't have the clearest ranking system (though what sports league does). I created my own. I first scraped all of the data for all of the UFC fighters. I got things like name, weight class, and record. I then got all of the data for all UFC fights since the early 2000s.
With all of this data I was able to create a stats based rankings system with UFC record, strength of schedule, finish percentage, and different statistics from fights. I gave the top 10 for every weight class and also men's and women's pound for pound.
These rankings are still a work in progress but they are a nice baseline. I am always looking of new ways to improve them.
I used python to do all of the scraping of the data and creation of the rankings. I used HTML to create the website
